INTRODUCTION 3.x
------------
Font Awesome (http://fontawesome.com) is the web's most popular icon set and
toolkit. This release of the Font Awesome Icons module supports Font Awesome
versions higher than 5.0. For older versions of Font Awesome, you should
download and install Font Awesome Icons 7.x-2.x. See the Font Awesome Icons
page on Drupal.org for more information.

"fontawesome" provides integration of "Font Awesome" with Drupal. Once enabled
"Font Awesome" icon fonts could be used as:

1. Directly inside of any HTML (node/block/view/panel). Inside HTML you can
   place Font Awesome icons just about anywhere with an <i> tag.

   Example for an info icon: <i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i>

   See more examples of using "Font Awesome" within HTML at:

USAGE
_____
Font Awesome can be used in many ways - you can manually insert Font Awesome
tags wherever you see fit after enabling the module, but there are other ways
as well. See
  https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js
for information on basic usage.

CSS Pseudo-elements - if you are using the older version of Font Awesome, CSS
with webfonts, you can use CSS Pseudo-elements for inserting your icons rather
than the default method. See
  https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/web-fonts-with-css#pseudo-elements
for more information on how to add the icons through CSS.
